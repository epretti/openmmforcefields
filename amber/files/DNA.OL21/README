The ff-nucleic-OL21.lib has 3 extra entries in the velocities table for DTN.
ParmEd fails due to this even though they are ignored by Amber.  This may not
actually be a ParmEd bug since the entries shouldn't be in the file.  Here the
relevant files are copied, with the final 3 lines removed from
ff-nucleic-OL21.lib.
